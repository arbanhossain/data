      "description": "About Us\n\nAt HDR, we specialize in engineering, architecture, environmental and construction services. While we are most well-known for adding beauty and structure to communities through high-performance buildings and smart infrastructure, we provide much more than that. We create an unshakable foundation for progress because our multidisciplinary teams also include scientists, economists... builders, analysts and artists. That's why we believe diversity is our greatest strength. HDR is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and an affirmative action employer.\n\nWatch our 'About Us' video\n\nWe believe that the way we work can add meaning and value to the world. That ideas inspire positive change. That coloring outside the lines can illuminate fresh perspectives. And that small details yield important realizations. Above all, we believe that collaboration is the best way forward.\n\nPrimary Responsibilities\n\nHDR is currently seeking to hire engineering students for an immersion program in Instrumentation & Controls (I&C) Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) / Human Machine Interface (HMI) programming for the summer period. The programmers will work full time as an integral part of the Building Engineering Services (BES) team in our Denver office. The primary role of these Automation System Technologists will be to perform hands on PLC and HMI programming tasks to support large programming projects but may also include other I&C or Electrical Engineering tasks.\n\nPLCs and HMIs are unique industrial automation equipment that are programmed to control factories, refineries, mining operations, water and wastewater facilities throughout the world. While some programming experience is desirable, this programming is unlike typical structured text programming language (C++, BASIC, Python\u2026). HDR will teach the programmers in the proper programming techniques and style. This position requires a programmer who can take direction on how to program the automation equipment for proper and safe process control. The programmer must be detailed oriented. An understanding of industrial, mining, water or wastewater processes is desirable, but not required. This position will include hands on training in Operational Technology (OT) best practices, good engineering judgment, project management and other topics. This position will work under Senior I&C lead engineer / programmers. The programs will be tested on HDRs OT lab that includes PLCs, hypervisor server and other equipment. A demonstration of the program features will be performed by the programmers during this period to HDR process personnel and possibly the customer.\n\nThis position includes primarily programming of PLCs and HMIs but may also branch into other areas including preparation of electrical diagrams, system block diagrams, facility electrical plans, P&IDs, logic diagrams, elementary control diagrams, communications diagrams, control valve sizing and operation, instrumentation specifications, and control equipment specifications.\n\nA self-sufficient programmer with good communication skills and the ability to take direction and guidance is required for this role. The programmer is expected to learn and progress in programming throughout the summer program. This is a team environment but will require the individual to work independently under direct supervision to adhere to strict programming standards of the project.\n\nThe location is in the downtown Denver area and no field work is expected. Parking is not available at the office but the office is close to the Civic Center for access to public transportation. Working from home or remotely is not practical due to the unique learning environment and lab system required to test the PLC code.\n\nRequired Qualifications\n\u2022 Desire to learn industrial controls and programming techniques and practices.\n\u2022 Undergraduate or graduate student majoring in electrical engineering, chemical engineering, mining engineering or related field.\n\u2022 Candidate must have excellent communication skills, both oral and written.\n\u2022 The candidate must be able to work independently, as a member of a multi-discipline consulting team\n\u2022 Strong computer knowledge of Microsoft Office, Windows OS\n\u2022 Programming knowledge is desired to better understand program structures, number systems, and Boolean logic.\n\u2022 Must have good problem-solving skills.\n\u2022 An attitude and commitment to being an active participant of our employee-owned culture is a must.\n\u2022 Color acuity is required (i.e. cannot be color blind).\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\u2022 ACAD Proficiency is a plus.\n\u2022 IT experience or knowledge is a plus.\n\u2022 Ethernet networking understanding and experience is a plus.\n\u2022 Junior Level or Higher\n\nWhy HDR\nAt HDR, we know work isn't only about who you work for; it's also about what you do and how you do it. Led by the strength of our values and a culture shaped by employee ownership, we network with each other, build on each other's contributions, and collaborate together to make great things possible. When you join HDR, we give you license to do the same. We help you take charge of your career, giving you multiple growth opportunities along the way.\n\nBenefits and Compensation:\nThe anticipated starting pay range for this position is $18 - $21 per hour and may be more or less depending upon skills, experience, education and geographical location.\n\nJob Field: Mining\nEmployee Status: Temporary",

For more information, visit www.Gearbox.com.\n\nThe Spark Senior Engine Programmer will help develop our Spark SDK, which provides game developers with a variety of web-enabled services. Spark is a living, breathing ecosystem and is a critical component of Gearbox Software; learn more about what Spark does [here] and [here].\n\nExperience designing software that is modular, scales well and is highly interoperable will be important (some game coders are weaponized and don't take kindly to inconsistent or inconvenient coding interfaces.)\n\nAs a Spark SDK Engineer, you'll work closely with our superior web service developers (they made us call them that) which means you'll have a voice in the design and standards discussions. You'll also work closely with game developers, QA, and external partners. That last one is a fancy term for third-party game developers which means you'll occasionally be asked to provide support, so your communication skills (written and verbal) will need to be sick, yo. Since this is an SDK that provides an API, documentation will be important. You don't have to be one of those weirdos that enjoys writing documentation, but it couldn't hurt.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\u2022 Develop and maintain best practices on how game code should work with our SDK\n\u2022 Add support for new web services/features as they come online in a consistent high-level interface that is easily consumable by game developers\n\u2022 Work with our superior web service developers to provide the best possible API that leverages the platform\n\u2022 Work with QA to ensure they have ways of recognizing and diagnosing issues that may arise\n\u2022 Write and maintain tests and demonstration apps to verify SDK functionality\n\u2022 Provide assistance to Release Engineers to keep our development pipeline running smoothly\n\u2022 Work with game developers to plan new SDK features and their interfaces\n\u2022 Provide feedback and guidance to junior programmers\n\nQualifications:\n\u2022 Bachelor\u2019s degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science or related technical discipline\n\u2022 Concrete understanding of RESTful APIs\n\u2022 A solid grounding in Computer Science fundamentals and deftness at system architecture\n\u2022 5+ years of software development and product delivery experience\n\u2022 Proficient in Modern C++\n\u2022 Must be a quick study to learn new technologies\n\u2022 Able to collaborate with multiple parties on design and standards decisions\n\u2022 Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal\n\u2022 Experience with low-level socket programming\n\u2022 Familiarity with WebSockets and WAMP\n\nBonus Points For:\n\u2022 Knowledge of network architecture and NAT traversal strategies\n\u2022 Experience with C, Python and MSBuild\n\u2022 Library development experience\n\u2022 Experience writing C++ code within the Unreal Engine\n\u2022 Multiple platform development experience (Windows, Linux, OSX, Xbox, Playstation, etc)\n\nGearbox Entertainment believes that all team members should be able to enjoy a work environment free from all forms of discrimination and harassment.
