(During the COVID-19 pandemic, we\u2019re offering flexible scheduling to staff as they manage life demands like childcare alongside their jobs.)\n\nAbout DataKind\n\nDataKind is a global nonprofit dedicated to harnessing the power of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) in the service of humanity. Named one of Fast Company's 2017 top 10 innovative nonprofits, DataKind teams talented pro bono experts from academia and industry with visionary changemakers to collaboratively design innovative solutions to tough social challenges. We help social organizations apply their data to predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, and AI needs in a way that both increases impact and prioritizes ethics.\n\u2022 We\u2019re 20,000 strong: DataKind volunteers hail from almost every country across the world, representing a community of technologists and social changemakers who believe in using data science and AI for a stronger planet and a more just and prosperous world.\n\u2022 We have served 350+ projects around the world: From using satellite imagery to measure crop yields to automating the fight against hate speech online, our volunteer community has shown up to support a range of humanitarian needs around the world. Through this approach, illustrating what we call \u201cthe art of the possible,\u201d these projects have resulted in more effective NGOs, more funding for social change organizations, and more awareness of the power (and pitfalls) of data science and AI in the social sector.\n\u2022 People are at the center of our process: The most advanced machine learning algorithms are useless if they\u2019re not designed for real people\u2019s problems. DataKind celebrates human-centered design principles that focus on the \u201cwhy,\u201d the \u201cfor whom,\u201d and the \u201cshould we\u201d long before we ever get going on the \u201cwhat.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cAI for Good\u201d will only succeed if it\u2019s \u201cAI for All\u201d: We\u2019ll continue our work until all people and all communities can use digital technology for the outcomes they want to see. We support not just the tech communities of today, but anyone in any community who wants to lead in how data technologies serve their needs fairly, with an emphasis on including individuals from groups that are historically underrepresented in technology or will be impacted by the intervention.\n\nDataKind has always known that we\u2019ll not be able to combat all of the world\u2019s looming challenges on the backs of individual, short-term projects alone. We\u2019re now focusing the DataKind network on issue areas, including improving health outcomes and increasing economic resilience for all. You can read more about our strategy here.\n\nAbout the Opportunity\n\nReporting to the Director of Technology, you will support multiple simultaneous data science project teams, standing up development and production cloud computing environments. You will be responsible for multiple cloud infrastructures and systems and their utilization, deployment, security, automation, testing and monitoring. Working with our small but agile Technology team, you will be responsible for maintenance, troubleshooting and improving of our existing cloud infrastructures, AWS, Azure, and GCP. Your role will encompass the use of a broad range of tools and technologies including products that support emerging AI/ML systems.\n\nIn this role, you\u2019ll work closely with our Product team and volunteer data scientists, as well as our Operations and Global Volunteers teams.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Do\n\nThe DevOps engineer will be responsible for Data Science Product and Internal Tooling DevOps Support, in addition to any other projects assigned by the manager:\n\u2022 Work with staff and volunteer data science teams to understand and gather their cloud computing needs, develop requirements, and deploy development and production environments and pipelines.\n\u2022 Be responsible for managing software releases, configuration, monitoring and support of all production systems.\n\u2022 Manage pro bono professional service engagements and cloud contractors.\n\u2022 Troubleshoot technical or functional issues in a complex data science cloud environment to provide timely resolution, with various applications and platforms that are supported by globally distributed teams.\n\u2022 Lead day-to-day tech project operations and activities while ensuring work is progressing as planned.\n\u2022 Bring a passion to stay on top of DevOps trends, experiment with and learn new AI/ML technologies.\n\u2022 Communicate and manage expectations of project teams, partner organizations, and global volunteers throughout the entire project life cycle.\n\u2022 Meet weekly with the product teams to provide detailed status updates on key cloud computing projects and workstreams.\n\nWho You Are\n\u2022 You are an experienced cloud DevOps engineer. You have a proven track record of successfully supporting full life-cycle tech projects in cloud computing environments, and love nothing more than successfully getting a project from the start line to the finish line. You have experience managing technical deliverables in either the volunteer, non-profit or tech spaces (or perhaps all three.) You are comfortable breaking complex problems down to bite-sized deliverables. You identify problems early and are proactive about creating solutions. And you have stellar relationship management and communication skills.\n\u2022 You are a technical problem solver. You can understand the language of project teams and translate it into technical requirements, and vice versa. You know how to put technology to task and excel in standing up development and production environments with multiple product teams. You enjoy contributing creatively and analytically in a problem-solving environment.\n\u2022 You are a self-starter and get stuff done. Whether it\u2019s on your own or through others, your experience, transparency, and organization allows you to get the nuts and bolts in place in record time, always with support and input from the rest of the organization. You are able to work independently with some guidance from your manager.\n\u2022 You bring people together. You know how to build buy-in from a variety of stakeholders, ensuring they have shared understanding of decisions and deliverables. You have time-tested strategies in your toolkit to produce reliable development and production environments that support consistent successful results.\n\u2022 You are values-aligned and understand the bigger picture. You share DataKind\u2019s values of humility, transparency, DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion), thoughtfulness, excellence, and approachability.
