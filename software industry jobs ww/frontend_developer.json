You will ensure that these components and the overall application are robust and easy to maintain. You will coordinate with the rest of the team working on different layers of the application and infrastructure. The folks in the Identity and Information Security team will be your companions on this ride. Your efforts will directly influence in shaping the enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution implementation across Gojek.\nAbout the Team\nGojek\u2019s Identity team, under the Enterprise Security team, plays an essential role in Gojek's success.

Although, that is not the only thing that we enjoy doing together as a team. Turns out, we have been enjoying WFH more than we thought we would Honestly, as much as we like our work, we find WFH makes it easier to take some downtime and chill at home. You'll find us binging the latest Netflix dramas, trying out hand at whipping up delicious meals at home, or battling it out in the gaming arena.\nAbout Us\nGojek is a Super App. It\u2019s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and dozen other products. It is Indonesia\u2019s first and only decacorn. It's also the only Southeast Asian startup to be part of Fortune's list of 'Companies That Changed The World.'\nOur Mission: To create and scale positive socio-economic impact for our customers, driver-partners, business and MSMEs.\nAs of 2021, Gojek processed more than $9 billion annualised gross transaction value across all markets where it operates - in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. We have the largest food delivery product in Asia, (outside of China), and the largest payments wallet in Southeast Asia.\nOur investors include Google, Facebook, PayPal, Sequoia Capital, Tencent Holdings among others.\nGojek is committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace and is an equal opportunity employer.
