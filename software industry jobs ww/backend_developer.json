We've distinguished ourselves by being named 2020's Energy Provider of the Year, which highlights our commitment to exceptional customer service. In many markets we are a leading employer on Glassdoor for best places to work.\n\nOur team\nWe are the latest acquisition of Octopus Energy, so our tech team needs to grow fast!\n\nWe follow a Kanban-like approach, using Google docs, BaseCamp, and Asana to specify and manage work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Loggly, Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production.\n\nEngineering standards are high. We thoroughly review and test code before it deploys, and maintain fast, high-value test suites. We have weekly tech talks, monthly blitz-days (eg sharpening our internal tools, upgrading dependencies) and can often be found at tech meet-ups and conferences.\nOur coding conventions are open-source and we maintain a tech blog.\n\nOctopus is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills.\n\nOur technology\nOn the server-side, we mainly use Python. Most of our websites are powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework. We also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting, plus Celery, RabbitMQ, SQS and Airflow for background processing.\n\nWe use AWS heavily, employing most of the \"Hashistack\" (eg Packer, Consul, Terraform) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, Django, ELB health checks and continuous delivery.\n\nClient-side, we use React, Redux and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React Native.\nWhat you'll do\n\u2022 We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The US energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's a lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.\n\u2022 We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.\n\u2022 Often, we can only give you the question and not the answer, because if we knew the answer, we wouldn't be hiring - are you someone who not only finds answers but creates value by coming back and asking better questions?\n\u2022 There's a great opportunity for disruption in the US energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a \"tracker\" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff\n\u2022 You'll be working for a company that's fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.\n\nWhat you'll have\n\u2022 General interest in technology and problem-solving; Diligent and thoughtful.\n\u2022 Good communication skills\n\u2022 Python\n\u2022 Django\n\u2022 Django REST Framework\n\u2022 Domain modelling\n\u2022 HTTP and REST APIs\n\u2022 Writing robust and fault-tolerant software\n\u2022 Celery and async processing\n\u2022 Postgres\n\u2022 Legally able to work within the USA Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:\n\u2022 AWS\n\u2022 Terraform, Packer, Consul\n\u2022 React and Redux\n\u2022 Professional understanding of the US energy domain\n\nWhat you'll love about us\n\u2022 Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options including FSAs\n\u2022 Unlimited paid time off - we know working hard means also being able to recharge as needed, we trust our employees to get the work done and take the time they need..\n\u2022 401(k) plan with employer match:\n\u2022 Parental leave. Biological, adoptive and foster parents are all eligible.\n\u2022 Pre-tax commuter benefits.\n\u2022 Flexible working environment: you need to shift around your schedule? You do you, we genuinely believe in work/life balance.\n\u2022 Equity Options: every Octopus employee owns part of the business. We're a team, working together towards huge goals. Every person is crucial to our success, you should be rewarded as such.\n\u2022 Modern office or co-working spaces depending on location.\n\u2022 Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!\n\nWe would prefer someone who can work post-pandemic in our Houston office. For those who want to work within the USA, we cannot sponsor H1 applications.\n\nAbove all, we're looking for someone who thrives on providing alternative opinions, challenging those around them and being challenged.\n\nIf this all sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.\n\nAt Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, a diverse and inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone. You are welcome to apply no matter your age, disability, gender, marriage or civil partnership status, pregnancy and maternity status, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation",
