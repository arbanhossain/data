Block is a proud equal opportunity employer. We work hard to evaluate all employees and job applicants consistently, without regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, gender expression or identity, sexual orientation, citizenship, or any other legally protected class.\n\nWe believe in being fair, and are committed to an inclusive interview experience, including providing reasonable accommodations to disabled applicants throughout the recruitment process. We encourage applicants to share any needed accommodations with their recruiter, who will treat these requests as confidentially as possible.

So, let's talk about what it’s like to work at Punch Through.\n\nAll About You\n\nSkills: You are an engineer who can develop software for connected products. At Punch Through, this goes beyond just turning specifications into code. As a design services company, we work with clients at all phases of the product life cycle. This means you will architect, implement, and lead challenging software projects. Regardless of what you’re working on, it should be approached with careful consideration of engineering tradeoffs between technical fitness, scope, and schedule in order to make decisions that best serve the client’s needs.\n\nCommunication: At Punch Through, we believe in transparency, not only as a company, but as an approach for working with clients. We value clear, honest, and frequent communication. As an engineer, you will lead communication of technical details and project direction to client stakeholders on projects of all magnitudes.\n\nCuriosity: We believe that if you aren’t curious about how the world works or you don’t challenge expectations, then you will never grow. Our team members relate with each other in large part due to our passion for learning and growing.\n\nIndependence: You’ll work as a lead developer on large challenging software projects so you must be motivated to operate and work independently. At times, you will be expected to lead the process of creating and reviewing product requirements and design specifications, with minimal guidance from team members or clients, and lead the design of systems or subsystems that can include components from any of Punch Through’s fields of specialization.\n\nCollaboration: We know that when we work together, everything is better. At Punch Through, collaboration is our preferred approach. As an engineering team member, you’ll work with teammates from a variety of disciplines to accomplish a range of tasks, from coordinating technical approach on a project with cross-discipline team members to interviewing and onboarding new team members or contributing to project proposals.\n\nGrowth: Be great today, be better tomorrow. One of the unifying characteristics of the Punch Through team is a drive for continuous personal improvement. As an engineer at Punch Through, you’ll work in an environment that leads to technical and non-technical growth, both organically through work and communication with others, as well as through a structured, focused approach. You will be expected to help develop less-experienced engineers through mentorship and guidance while being open to learning new things yourself.\n\nPart of creating this environment of growth is making sure people feel comfortable to ask questions and make mistakes. As such, all our engineers strive to be ego-free and focus on working together with the team and clients, not against. Punch Through is a place where people feel comfortable saying what’s on their mind. All team members are encouraged to share their thoughts, regardless of whether it is specifically related to their position. This includes contributing to the continuous improvement of best practices and processes within the software engineering team and participating in the growth of the overall company culture.\n\nOur Culture Statement\n\nAt Punch Through, our team and culture are everything to us. We value having empathy for one another and recognizing the challenges we are all going through, both inside and outside of the workplace. By doing so, we maximize our ability to help our team members be happy, successful, and comfortable being themselves.\n\nTo be in it for the long haul, we believe our employees should be relaxed, creative, and able to do great work without always needing to be serious. Transparency and honesty about who we are helps us to resolve internal and external conflict, develop deeper relationships, and most importantly, be happy.\n\nPunch Through’s culture is at the heart of what sets us apart from other companies. We take pride in our unique abilities and strive to do the best work in our industry. We never stop working to improve. We teach each other, we teach our clients, and we seek learning opportunities in all forms. We’re hungry for knowledge in the world and seek to leverage each other’s experiences. We’re building a company where everyone can be their best selves and have a meaningful impact on one another and on our industry.\n\nIf this resonates with you, odds are you'll fit right in. If that’s the case, we want to hear from you!\n\nPlease apply today! We look forward to getting to know you",

Those beliefs drive us to work alongside schools to support great teaching so that we can work towards guaranteeing that all students are receiving high quality instruction. We partner with over 900 schools - both district and charter - in underserved communities around the country, thus impacting more than 330,000 students. Third-party evaluations confirm that when schools have the right basic conditions in place and partner with ANet, they achieve 6-8 months of additional learning over a two-year period compared to schools not partnering with ANet.\n\nAt ANet we are committed to living out our core values, both across our organization and with our partners. We acknowledge that systemic inequities impact student access to opportunities and that in order to ensure educational equity for all students, we must center on the experiences of those from marginalized communities to guide our work.
